<p><strong>Difficulty: Easy</strong></p>
<h3 id="flag-format-is-xsstctf-redacted-">flag format is xsstctf{REDACTED}</h3>
<h2 id="solution-">Solution:</h2>
<p>The first clue to solving this challenge is that the encrypted text starts with vinegar. Vinegar is a sour-tasting liquid made through the fermentation of ethanol by acetic acid bacteria. It is commonly used in cooking, cleaning, and food preservation. Not very useful in terms of cybersecurity and capture-the-flags. But from experience, we know that there is an encryption method which sounds similar to vinegar, called vigenere. </p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of how a vigenere cipher works:</p>
<p>Say we are given a plaintext that we want to send to our ally which has to be encrypted quickly.</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-attribute">ATTACKATDAWN</span>
</code></pre><p>In order to encrypt this, we need an encryption key. The length of the encryption key has to be equal to the length of the ciphertext. Let's say we pick the key <code>LEMON</code>. Since <code>ATTACKATDAWN</code> has 12 characters, while <code>LEMON</code> has 5 characters, we can repeat the key until it is equal to the length of the ciphertext, thus getting a key of:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-attribute">LEMONLEMONLE</span>
</code></pre><p>Each letter in the plaintext is shifted forward in the alphabet based on the corresponding letter in the key.</p>
<h4 id="formula-"><strong>Formula:</strong></h4>
<p>For each letter at position <code>i</code>, encryption is performed as:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-attr">C_i</span> = (P_i + K_i) mod <span class="hljs-number">26</span>
</code></pre><p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>C_i</code> = Ciphertext letter at position <code>i</code></li>
<li><code>P_i</code> = Plaintext letter at position <code>i</code> (converted to a number: A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25)</li>
<li><code>K_i</code> = Key letter at position <code>i</code> (converted similarly)</li>
<li><code>mod 26</code> ensures values wrap around within the alphabet</li>
</ul>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Plaintext</th>
<th>A</th>
<th>T</th>
<th>T</th>
<th>A</th>
<th>C</th>
<th>K</th>

<th>T</th>
<th>D</th>

<th>N</th>
</tr>

<td>L</td>

<td>P</td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So, the final ciphertext is:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-attribute">LXFOPVEFRNHR</span>
</code></pre><p>To decrypt, the process is reversed by shifting <strong>backward</strong> using the key.</p>
<h4 id="formula-"><strong>Formula:</strong></h4>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-attr">P_i</span> = (C_i - K_i) mod <span class="hljs-number">26</span>
</code></pre><p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>P_i</code> = Decrypted plaintext letter at position <code>i</code></li>
<li><code>C_i</code> = Ciphertext letter at position <code>i</code></li>
<li><code>K_i</code> = Key letter at position <code>i</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Using the same example, we reverse the shifts and retrieve the original plaintext: <strong>"ATTACKATDAWN"</strong>.</p>
<p>Knowing how a vigenere cipher works allows us to reverse the key, and thus find the plaintext encoded to vinegar{t1wzy3vl_15_ffu_wp+x3y_oy3i4m_4wxo0gex_w0+s_ey3_uliznyy3}. Since we know that xsstctf is encoded to vinegar, we can figure out that the first 7 characters of the key is <code>YQVLEHM</code>.</p>
<p>Without any extra clues, it is impossible to figure out the rest of the key. But what we know from vigenere ciphers, is that if the length of the key is not equal to the length of the ciphertext, so it is not too far fetched to think that maybe this 7 character key <code>YQVLEHM</code> was repeated. </p>
<p>Testing this theory, by decoding vinegar{t1wzy3vl_15_ffu_wp+x3y_oy3i4m_4wxo0gex_w0+s_ey3_uliznyy3} with YQVLEHM using <a href="https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher">dCode</a>.
This gives us the flag xsstctf{v1gen3re_15_the_be+t3r_ca3s4r_4lth0ugh_b0+h_ar3_insecur3}</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 1.1em; color: var(--accent);">flag: xsstctf{v1gen3re_15_the_be+t3r_ca3s4r_4lth0ugh_b0+h_ar3_insecur3}</span></strong></p>

    description: "Writeup of the CyberCard CTF challenge, focusing on AES and HMAC vulnerabilities.",
    category: "Cybersecurity",
    source: "Unpublished",
    link: "",
    content: `<h2>CyberCard CTF Challenge Writeup</h2>

<h3>Introduction to the Challenge</h3>
<p>
    The "CyberCard" challenge provides participants with a pseudo-credit card system where you can either generate a test card or submit a card for validation. The goal is to submit a valid card with a balance of exactly <strong>13371337</strong> dollars to obtain the flag. 
</p>

<h3>Key Technologies Explained</h3>

<h4>AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)</h4>
<p>
    AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm widely used across the globe to secure data. In this challenge, AES is used in GCM (Galois/Counter Mode), which provides both confidentiality (encryption) and integrity (authentication) ‚Äî although here, as we will soon laugh about, the integrity is handled elsewhere (and poorly).
</p>

<h4>HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)</h4>
<p>
    HMAC is a mechanism to verify both the data integrity and authenticity of a message, typically using a cryptographic hash function like SHA-256. In CyberCard, the ciphertext is protected with an HMAC using a key derived from the number 1337. Ironically, the true number here is 1337 ways to break it.
</p>

<h3>Identifying the Loophole</h3>
<p>
    Observant players would notice several critical flaws:
    <ul>
        <li>The AES key is random for the session but the nonce (normally random and unique) is <strong>fixed as the key itself</strong>. This is a massive cryptographic mistake because it allows predictability.</li>
        <li>The system relies <em>only</em> on the HMAC for authentication, not on AES-GCM's internal authentication tag.</li>
        <li>The HMAC key is <strong>known and constant</strong> ‚Äî it's simply 1337 padded to 16 bytes, which is obviously insecure.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Because of these missteps, if you get a ciphertext and its corresponding plaintext, you can forge a valid new ciphertext for a modified plaintext of the <strong>same length</strong> and produce a valid HMAC tag yourself.
</p>

<h3>How the Exploit Was Forged</h3>
<p>
    First, we generated a valid card using option 1. This gave us:
    <ul>
        <li>The original plaintext (name and balance).</li>
        <li>The original ciphertext and HMAC tag.</li>
    </ul>
    Now, since the HMAC key is known and the encryption is length-preserving, we could work some cryptographic wizardry:
</p>

<h3>Understanding the Exploit Script</h3>

<h4>Step 1: Extract Original Ciphertext</h4>
<p>
    The script slices off the HMAC tag from the received hex string. Since the tag length is 32 bytes, it simply cuts the last 64 hex characters.
</p>

<h4>Step 2: Reconstruct Original Plaintext</h4>
<p>
    The plaintext is recreated using the printed name and balance. This needs to be <strong>exactly</strong> what was used originally.
</p>

<h4>Step 3: Create Target Plaintext</h4>
<p>
    To reach the "13371337" balance, the script crafts a new plaintext. The trick is that the new plaintext must be the <strong>same length</strong> as the original, otherwise the XOR trickery would not align.
</p>
<p>
    It even intelligently adjusts the name length by trimming characters to fit if necessary. A short name, but a long flag-winning smile.
</p>

<h4>Step 4: Forge Target Ciphertext</h4>
<p>
    Now comes the magic: 
    <code>C2 = C1 XOR P1 XOR P2</code> 
    This works because of the nature of stream cipher-like modes (like AES-GCM encryption without auth). XORing the original ciphertext with the original plaintext removes the effect of the plaintext, and applying the target plaintext effectively "re-encrypts" it correctly.
</p>

<h4>Step 5: Forge Target HMAC</h4>
<p>
    Because the HMAC key is known, we simply generate a new HMAC of the new ciphertext. No dark arts needed.
</p>

<h4>Step 6: Combine and Submit</h4>
<p>
    The final forged card is the forged ciphertext concatenated with the forged tag. Submit this hex string into the program under option 2, and voil√†, you win the flag.
</p>

<h3>Detailed Explanation of Challenge Code</h3>

<h4>Card Generation and Encryption</h4>
<code>
aes_key = get_random_bytes(16)
hmac_key = (1337).to_bytes(16, byteorder='big')
</code>
<p>Here, the AES key is random but the HMAC key is fixed. Immediate danger signs for any pentester worth their salt.</p>

<code>
cipher = AES.new(aes_key, AES.MODE_GCM, nonce=aes_key)
card_ct = cipher.encrypt(card_pt)
</code>
<p>Using the AES key as the nonce is catastrophic. Nonces should never be predictable or reused, but here it's literally the key reused as a nonce.</p>

<code>
hmac = HMAC.new(hmac_key, digestmod=SHA256)
tag = hmac.update(card_ct).hexdigest()
</code>
<p>Separate HMAC protects the ciphertext ‚Äî but with a fixed, known key. It's like putting a lock on your bike but taping the key next to it.</p>

<h4>Card Validation</h4>
<code>
card = bytes.fromhex(card)
ct, tag = card[:-TAG_LEN], card[-TAG_LEN:]
</code>
<p>During validation, the HMAC is verified by recomputing it. No verification of AES-GCM's built-in authentication happens at all.</p>

<code>
cipher = AES.new(aes_key, AES.MODE_GCM, nonce=aes_key)
pt = cipher.decrypt(ct).decode()
</code>
<p>Decrypts the ciphertext. Since the nonce is the same as the key, predictability leaks all over the place.</p>

<h3>Detailed Walkthrough of the Exploit Script</h3>

<h4>Setup Values</h4>
<code>
original_name = "Jane Soh"
original_bal = "227"
original_card_hex = "..."
hmac_key = (1337).to_bytes(16, byteorder='big')
</code>
<p>Inputs from the printed card and the known HMAC key.</p>

<h4>Extracting Ciphertext</h4>
<code>
original_ct_hex = original_card_hex[:-TAG_LEN_BYTES * 2]
C1 = bytes.fromhex(original_ct_hex)
</code>
<p>Separates ciphertext from HMAC tag.</p>

<h4>Creating New Plaintext</h4>
<code>
target_name = "A" * (len(original_name) - 5)
P2 = (target_name + '\n' + "13371337").encode()
</code>
<p>Adjusts name length to keep everything perfectly aligned for XOR operations.</p>

<h4>Forging Ciphertext</h4>
<code>
C2 = bytes(c ^ p1 ^ p2 for c, p1, p2 in zip(C1, P1, P2))
</code>
<p>Applies XOR to transform the ciphertext into one encrypting our target plaintext.</p>

<h4>Generating New HMAC</h4>
<code>
hmac_calc = HMAC.new(hmac_key, digestmod=SHA256)
hmac_calc.update(C2)
T2 = hmac_calc.digest()
</code>
<p>New ciphertext needs a new valid HMAC, generated using the same fixed key.</p>

<h4>Building Final Card</h4>
<code>
exploit_card_hex = C2.hex() + T2.hex()
</code>
<p>Simply combine and ready to submit.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
    This challenge teaches important lessons: why random nonces matter, why relying on separate HMACs (with guessable keys!) is dangerous, and why cryptography is a "no half-measures" field. As they say, cryptography is like coding ‚Äî you get it wrong, and suddenly your life savings are buying someone else a yacht.
